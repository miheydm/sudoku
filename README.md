Hello, Earthmen!

solveSudoku.py is used to solve the Sudoku puzzle by computer using python3 instructions.
The job is still in progress though by hand it works for some cells...

DESCRIPTION

PERFECT (RELEASE) VERSION:
The user inputs the digits from the puzzle as a string from top to bottom from left to right. "0" is used (for now) for cells with unknown values. The result of his/her input is displayed in the terminal window. After some python3 magic the solved puzzle is displayed as well (also in terminal. No GUI for now, sorry). The values that were solved by the AI will be displayed in color. Or not :).

IN-PROGRESS VERSION:
The input information is stored as variables (string types). Most of the functions used by the "solving algorithm" are ready. At least running them by hand using predefined arguments provides the proper result. The main work now is to automate this process.
